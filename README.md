# Password
This is of my daily mini projects to sharpen my python skills. This password generator I was able to learn and implement different methods like the random.shuffle() method, and the random.choice() methods. It is interesting to see that python uses such useful methods for us to be able to use. I understand now why python is used so much throughout the development community.
